# BookStop

This is a project on routing functions. I used a basic demonstration and refactored the routing and style. I used SPA type routing with an offcanvas attribute. The offcanvas will take the user to a side window of information and a drop button link menu to choose a title. each title will have a link button to gain access to the offcanvas.
